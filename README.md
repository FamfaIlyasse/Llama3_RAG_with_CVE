# Llama3_RAG_with_CVE
# 🔐 CVE Information Retrieval with RAG  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to improve CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) information retrieval by implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. It compares the results of a traditional model without external knowledge versus a RAG-enhanced model that incorporates structured CVE data.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **CVE Knowledge Base**: JSON-based storage of CVEs with key details.  
✅ **RAG Integration**: Uses embeddings for better query responses.  
✅ **Comparison Mode**: Run the model with or without RAG.  
✅ **Automated Indexing**: Converts JSON CVE data into searchable embeddings.  
✅ **CLI Testing**: Query the system directly from the terminal.
